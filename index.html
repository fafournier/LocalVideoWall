    <h1>Local Video Wall</h1>
    <p>LocalVideoWall is a single html static file that allows you to specify a few local video files and it display a wall of videos. Nothing is uploaded to any server. Everything is kept locally in your browser. This works offline if you save the page first.</p>
    <p>There's not many bells or whisles. This was just a little experiment to build the most lightweight tool for this without using external dependencies.</p>
    <p>Pull requests to improve or add functionalities are welcome.</p>
