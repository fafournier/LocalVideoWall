# LocalVideoWall
A single simple page that takes video files and tiles them to make a video wall. No upload anywhere. All local in your browser.

There's not many bells or whisles. This was just a little experiment to build the most lightweight tool for this without using external dependencies.

Pull requests to improve or add functionalities are welcome.
